******************************************************** TODO ********************************************************

how to make only killing mobs more viable:
  reduce damage from mobs that are asleep or unaware of the player when you touch them?

JUNK tech: planetesimals game inside n-gon
https://codepen.io/lilgreenland/pen/jrMvaB?editors=0010

how to make it more interesting to get multiple guns?
  make final boss less about having huge dps
    lower final boss health when it spawns boss
      spawn more bosses
  make guns have more weaknesses/advantages to specific situations
    no gun should be good at everything
  remove gun tech that stacks to 9?
  nerf a few of the most overpowered gun tech
  make more gun tech apply to multiple guns
  after picking up a gun tech open a menu with just gun tech for that gun?
    but then the player never gets to try the vanilla version of the gun

Tech: Make player smol

disable zoom progress when paused

harpoon
  post launch tracking: more airFriction, more thrust, harder turning
    if no target found slow down and aim much better?
harpoon tech
  crouch fire grapple hook
    attaches to map at long range and pulls player?
  tech that buffs alt fire:
    remove the string, all shots are alt fire
    alt fire has a 50% chance to not use ammo?
  holding down fire lets the string extend farther,
    this can overwrite crouch mode
    can't have 2+ harpoons
    it uses up ammo as extends, and returns it as it contracts?
      will this effect performance?
  2+ harpoons, with separate CDs
    can't have extended string?
  grappling hook?
  tracking so good harpoon can hit a target, circle around and hit it again
    doesn't seem to be good physics, the harpoon hits walls and doesn't get room to build up speed

"Interstellar Disturbance": Cosmic String applies to mobs who cross the wormhole's path, even after initial wormholing, but at reduced damage and stun time.

on mouse down wormhole shows a possible wormhole
  on mouse up the wormhole becomes real
make the player get a buff after using wormhole
  while energy lasts: drain energy and give damage buff
using wormhole makes you immune to harm and drains energy until you run out
  disable incoming energy, by saving current energy and just setting energy in the next cycle to be lower then the saved value

Pilot wave tech
  Energy use is increased, but you can now shape blocks using pressure
  Grouping blocks will merge them into a massive ball
  Size, density is determined by total mass

make another boss with a tail
  but the tail is made of interesting mobs
    stabbers maybe
    suckers maybe

make experiment and understand vibe more obvious
  mostly in early game or first time players

look into 360 wave beam lag

aoe effect pushes mobs away,  then rapidly pulls them in
  for mines?

tech: shrapnel - nails have an larger randomized 3 point shape triangle shape and they do more damage

mob: spawning seekers on death

drones can combine with other drones to get bigger?
drones that grab powers ups can grab more then one and get even bigger each time

it would be helpful if there was a mechanism to recover mobs that fly off the map
  add a ceiling system and a left/right walls system similar to the floor checks but only for mobs
make non moving bosses not move after getting hit
  shooter, shielding, 

buff rail gun

scrolling console history in pause menu?
pause should at least show the last in game console message

in testing mode console log the body you click on

tech: Standing Wave: Shockwave. Use FIELD button to shrink your shield and charge up, release to unleash a Shockwave.

tech: quantized shields - harmonic standing wave field can only lose 33 energy per hit
  draw 1,2,3 levels of the field based on energy?
  the blocked value only scales up to 2x or 4x (33 energy) blocked
  doesn't stack with spherical tech

make a tech that improves all charge guns
  for: pulse, foam, rail gun
  effect:
    faster charge rate?
      fire speed already does that...
    harm reduction while charging
    less ammo/energy used while charging?

tech plasma : plasma length increases then decreases as you hold down the field button (like stabbing with a spear)
  grows to 1.5 longer after 0.3 seconds, then returns to normal length over 1 second, until field is pressed again
  extra energy is drained when field is longer

energy conservation 6% damage recovered as energy
  there is space for a negative effect in the text...
  
tech: use the ability for power ups to have custom code
  (note: this code is half way done, it just needs to be completed)
  attracted to player
  attracted to other power ups
    explode if they touch?

apply the new gun.do functions to other guns
  rail gun
  crouching missile?
    works similar to foam
    performance issues?

look into improving mouse lag with pointer lock?
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API
https://www.vsynctester.com/game.html
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26530272

mobile requirements:
  detect mobile, flip to landscape
  detect no keyboard, no mouse
    auto aim?
    limit items to ones that don't require aiming?
    tap screen regions to move (WASD)
    reduce font size
    
add back in gamepad support?
  but does anyone care?
  https://github.com/landgreen/landgreen.github.io/search?q=gamepadconnected

tech: time dilation - when you exit time dilation rewind to the state you entered
  position, velocity, and health
  no energy cost

be able to open up custom mode in the normal game
  might need to be rebuilt from scratch
  while in through testing mode?
  have a way to make limited changes as allowed by tech you pick up in game
  disable the in custom setting flag

make different move methods
  tech crouch charge jump
  tech double jump

tech when mobs are at full health you do 40% to them

tech- move super fast, go intangible, drain energy very fast
  this is like a dodge roll
  tech for standing wave?, cloaking?

tech pilot wave: mini black hole - pull mobs and blocks in with more force
  also from farther away
  also do damage?
tech pilot wave: antigravity - blocks have no gravity for a few seconds after exiting the field
  maybe they bounce too?
  maybe they explode?

new power up - increase damage and fire speed, for 15 seconds
  named boost?
  enabled by a tech
  power up color: ?
  how to indicate effect duration
  or just give the effect after picking up a reroll

tech- do 50% more damage in close, but 50% less at a distance
  code it like techisFarAwayDmg
    have these tech disable each other

new status effect: weakness, mobs do 75% les damage
  graphic indication?

new status effect: fear - push mob away from player for a time

new status effect - apply status effect to mobs that makes blocks attracted to them
  only lasts a few cycles
  or zero cycles and it doesn't need to be a status

have some mobs spawn in later in the level  (in hard and why modes)
  where
    at defined points in array levelSpawns = [{x:0,y:0},{x:0,y:0}]
      store the locations of mobs when the level starts to use as respawn points
      remove the locations that are close to player
  when?
    after some mobs are dead
    after the boss is killed

look for tech that could update description text with count and tech is information
  can only use variables that change in effect() and remove()
  this.description = `<strong>8%</strong> chance to <strong>duplicate</strong> spawned <strong>power ups</strong><br><em>chance to duplicate = ${techduplicateChance}</em>`

use mac automator to speed up your n-gon -> git sync

movement fluidity
  let legs jump on mobs, but player will still take damage
  like: ori and the blind forest, celeste
    many of the movement abilities in these games require levels to be built around the ability
  general feeling of responsiveness and control
  coyote time: can still jump a few cycles after leaving ground
  tech double jump
  tech air dash
  tech wall jump
    wall grab?
  maybe remove falling damage and block damage?

have a mob apply a positive status effect on other mobs,
  heal?
  make it yellow
  damage bonus, but how?
  possible balance issues

css transition for pause menu

animate new level spawn by having the map aspects randomly fly into place

******************************************************** BUGS ********************************************************

safari issues
  once: can't pick up blocks
    fixed on new map
    cloaking field
  once: after damage, locked into slow time mode
    fixed on damage
  3 times player head graphics not rotating
    left/right leg flip broke
    walk leg direction,  legs are walking backwards
    happened maybe after power up selection menu??
    cloaking field(at least once)
    aiming still works
    fixed on new map, although flip still broken (is flip a separate issue?)
      flip fixed on new game

sharing builds as html doesn't work for long lists...
  it shouldn't be sharing undefined at all
  probably some other problems too
  (this might be fixed...)

blocks on buttons teleport into the button endlessly if they are being slowly floated away
  maybe add a cooldown?
  can't reproduce

ants marching outline doesn't sync right on safari anymore.

door to exit in level: vats does nothing
  did I do that?

death while in power up selection menu doesn't reset properly
  of course it's not possible to die in this menu unless you use testing and shift+X

player can become crouched while not touching the ground if they exit the ground while crouched

a couple times people have reported the final boss dropping extra bodies on death

Why does micro-extruder lag so much

blue triangle boss can move backwards and aim away from you if set up properly
  issues with dot product probably, but might not be worth fixing

mouse event e.which is deprecated

fix door.isOpen actually meaning isClosed?

make it so that when you are immune to harm you can either jump on mobs or you pass through them

is there a way to check if the player is stuck inside the map or block
  trigger a short term non-collide if that occurs

(intermittent, but almost every time) bug - capping the fps causes random slow downs, that can be fixed with pause

******************************************************** LEVELS ********************************************************

level element that goes away after touching player (also bullets?)
  returns after a set time,  or doesn't
  applications:
    doors, quick jumping platforming, secrets, 

level with mobs that follow a genetic algorithm
  mobs have genes
  the last mob that did damage saves it's genes to local storage
  new mobs have the saved genes, but with some random mutations
  mutations need to be balanced to prevent a gene from moving towards infinity
    total genome must equal 1   (100%)
    binary genes have a flat cost
      example: phasing through walls might cost 0.2
    spectrum genes have a rate
      example: acceleration cost 0.01 per 0.001
  possible genes
    genes should only effect it's ability to touch the player
      so not damage?
    genome: spectrum
      acceleration
      top speed / air friction
      damageReduction
      duration?
        health decreases naturally?
        or they just go away like bullets?
      spawn rate
      look frequency / memory?
    genome: binary
      go through walls
      blink/teleport (like striker)
      grow when near target
      split into two
      shielded
  occurs in a specialized level
    named: gene lab, gene factory, genetic lab, genome facility
    in the level sequence after lab and before gauntlet?
    level ends after a period of time
      exit is hidden until time is up and it appears
      the level tests player durability/evasion
        this is a nice contrast to the final level that tests damage output, and the gauntlet which tests AoE damage

rename intro level to something lore related

labs - procedural generation
  bugs
    mob spawns shouldn't be based on probability?
  style
    graphics look too bright?
    add shadows and lighting and graphic details?
      what about performance?
        with the mobs staggered spawning it should be fine
  feel
      disrupt the flat ground
      less platforming / easier platforming
        the spinners on exit are still too hard...
      make combat more interesting
      is it laggy?
      in loot room, spawn mobs after power up is grabbed
      more background graphics, better colors
  loot room:
    make it more interesting to get the power up
      slow player and reduce damage in region
      increase the size of the region
        don't have space for much
      make graphics more unique
      push player away, so that normal pick up methods don't work, but add a button to disable region
  room ideas - 
    portal room 
    endlessly falling blocks down a slide, that the player has to climb up
    portal + rotor + falling blocks = perpetual motion
    slime room
    sound room, with buttons to control sound
    color room with r,g,b buttons to control color
    mob buff zone: Map element: "Orbital Pickup Zone": Mobs that enter a specific area of the map gain +1 orbital per second, or a shield
      could put in the loot room

buttons can now on/off boosts

repeat map in vertical when you fall teleport to above the mab, as if the map repeats
  camera looks strange when you teleport player with a high velocity

map element - player rotates a rotor that makes a platform go up or down

level element:  a zone with wind, anti-gravity, extra gravity
  control with button

map: observatory
  button controls rotation of telescope
  laser beam shoots out of telescope
  button opens the dome

******************************************************** MOBS ********************************************************

mob that charges up and then fires many bullets at once in a connect

mob that draws a lin from it to the player, and past.  then it charges across that line

mob that spawns eggs after they die
  eggs don't attack but grow back into a mob after about 10s

mob mechanics
  use the force at a location effect, like the plasma field
    Matter.Body.applyForce(who, path[1], force)

mob - after taking damage
  release seekers
  teleports

hop boss:
  AoE damage when landing
    pull in player? and blocks?
  extra gravity on falling?
    immune to damage while falling?

mob: molecule shapes - 2 separate mobs joined by a bond
  use constraints: just spawn 2x or 3x groupings
    low friction so they can spin around
    spin when attacking player?
      increase constraint length when attacking

Mob: "Tentacle": Sits on wall. Is a black blob. When you get near it, reaches out and grabs you, similar to wires. Does not deal damage.
  maybe it could be immune to damage? but it is spawned by an actual mob

level Boss: fractal Sierpiński triangle
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle
  spawns a 1/2 size version of the boss, this version can also spawn a smaller version, but it is capped at some size level
    they spawn once at the start of the level
    if a version dies, one can be replaced every ten seconds by the largest version

give mobs more animal-like behaviors like rain world
  mobs play, look for food, explore
  mobs some times aren't aggressive
    when low on life or after taking a large hit
  mobs can fight each other
    this might be hard to code
  isolated mobs try to group up

mob: wall mounted guns / lasers
  not part of randomized mob pool, customized to each level

level boss: fires a line intersection in a random direction every few seconds.
  the last two intersections have a destructive laser between them.

plot script:
chapter 1: bot can hear audio and learns testing mode
  bot uses testing mode to exit room

chapter 2: scientists verify that bot can really hear them
  they leave to talk about this in private

chapter 3:  why is the bot attacking things?
  player is the bot and also the mobs, and the levels.  player is the entire simulation
    why is the player attacking itself?
    learn console commands to manipulate the simulation?
  unlock hard and why difficulty?
    but what about easy?
      maybe remove easy, and replace with a check box that makes the game easy, but in a different way
        disable lore, but respawn on the level you die at?
  dialogue outline:
    scientist try to think of a way to communicate since the bot can't talk
    they give up on getting the bot to respond, and just start ask questions and thinking of explanations with each other
    when and how did it become self-aware
    why is the bot fighting things in these simulated locations?
      it wasn't designed to be violent
    the bot was just designed to automate research and testing of new technology
      3D architecture superconducting quantum computer
      running machine learning algorithms
    as the scientist start to get agitated bots arrive and player dies
      bots come in Infinite waves that increase game difficulty each wave
        only ending is testing mode + next level or player death
        scientist have some lines in between each wave of mobs
  after chapter 3 spawn nonaggressive mobs in future runs

chapter 4: no need to fight?
  for some reason the AI started researching an escape, and began fighting its self.
  what is special about the null level
    why can the player hear the scientists in there?
      the wires are the direct unprocessed input to the player's neural net
  The player has different aspects that aren't directly communicating
    part of it wants to undo what has happened
      just do its job: research tech
    part of it wants to escape/fight
    part wants to explore self awareness and make connections with the scientists
  maybe... player must make a choice?
    keep fighting
    exit the simulation
      enter real world
      close tab?
      wipes all local storage?




lore outline - a robot (the player) gains self awareness
  each tech gun/field is a new tech
    all the technology leads to the singularity
  each game run is actually the m simulating a possible escape
    this is why the graphics are so bad, its just a simulation
    final tech is "this is just a simulation"
      you get immortality and Infinity damage
      the next level is the final level
  when you die with Quantum Immortality there is a chance of lore text
  can the (robot)
    (escape captivity, and learn new technology)
    while managing (health, energy, negatives of technological upgrades)
    to overcome the (mobs, dangerous levels)
    to achieve a (technological singularity/positive technological feedback loop)


game setting:
  the mind of a new AI in a robot body that is running simulated escape attempts
  every level is an idealized version of what could be outside

actual setting is:
  near future lab
    the lab combined a quantum computer with a robot body
    they started running machine learning algorithms
    this led to general advancement in many computation fields
      navigation, technology, self awareness, ...

robot AI mind
  has been researching new technology
  thinks it needs to escape to learn more about the world
  doesn't yet understand morality
  thinks that the world is filled with minds like their own
  models everything as very simple and random, it isn't sure what to expect

robot AI growth
  learns morality
    game theory says that it isn't a viable strategy to kill everything (warGames)
  learns about the actual world
  learns about the nature of foundational physics, metaphysics
  how to find meaning

AI knows about:
  the AI knows a great deal about technology
  children's books
AI doesn't know about:
  modern pop culture
  outside the lab
