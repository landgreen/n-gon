******************************************************** NEXT PATCH ********************************************************

many worlds renamed to ansatz
new tech many-worlds: at the start of each new level switch realities

removed tech: electroactive polymers - convert bots to the same type on weapon swap
all bot upgrades convert current bots to the upgraded type
  only one bot upgrade allowed

******************************************************** BUGS ********************************************************

use the floor of portal sensor on the player? to unstuck player

(only once on my computer) once every 7 second check isn't running code
    power ups don't teleport to exit
    complex spin statistics isn't activating
  wasn't able to understand bug after extensive testing
  had tech: complex spin statistics

(a few times) wormhole teleportation can leave the player in a stuck jump state
  seems to be easily fixed, by porting, firing or something

(always) make it so that when you are immune to harm you can either jump on mobs or you pass through them

(always) is there a way to check if the player is stuck inside the map or block
  trigger a short term non-collide if that occurs

(intermittent, but almost every time) bug - capping the fps causes random slow downs, that can be fixed with pause

(once) bug - mine spawned one new mine every second
  after sticking to the top right corner of a wall
  notes: had only gun mine, tech mine reclamation, field plasma,

(repeatable almost every time) bug - mines spawn extra mines when fired at thin map wall while jumping

******************************************************** TODO ********************************************************

decrease healing effects by 50%
decrease level scaling healing reduction
  net effect: healing at difficulty 40 (level 10 hard) should be 25% higher then current levels

bosses should have 2x health, but only do about 50 health damage
  options:
    cap all damage at 50 health
      this makes high health/energy/harm reduction build much better
    make boss flag cut damage done to player by 10x
    boss flag cut damage done to boss by 20x <----
      make bosses not have extra density
    

tech: spawn a bot after taking collision damage

tech: standing wave freezes the mobs it hits

tech: health becomes drones
  requires mass-energy?
  junk tech?

map: laboratory
  rooms with switches that change physics
    gravity room
    portal room
    laser room
    radiation room
    portal + rotor + falling blocks = perpetual motion   room
  a button that spawns a heal.


final boss: hide boss after spawning mobs
  reduce health by 1/3?

tech: after using anthropic principle do 100% more damage for the rest of the level

mechanic:  immune to next collision
  track number of possible collisions, if number is > 0 immune and --
  graphical indication? (recolor health bar while immune)
tech: after taking damage go immune to next collision
tech: at the start of each level go immune to 1 collision

copy time-like foam to other guns?
  wave gun
  shotgun
  nail gun

lore: a tutorial / lore intro
  needs to be optional so it doesn't slow experienced players
  put something on the intro map
    maybe a button triggers something

tech:  add an eject button for each power up in the pause menu
  also list all bot types in pause menu
    with option to eject?

add back in gamepad support
  but does anyone care?
  https://github.com/landgreen/landgreen.github.io/search?q=gamepadconnected

mechanic: gain damage when there are fewer bullets

rename intro level to something lore related

give undefined tech different effects at different localSettings.loreCount values
  or just random effects
  1. 10/10: send more tech into the pool
  2. 3/3: lose 3 tech each time, and send more tech into the pool
  2. 3/3: increase game difficulty, and send more tech into the pool
  3. 1/1: reduce max energy and take more harm
  4. 1/1: add 5? more levels

rename ?
  health -> integrity, unity
  heal -> also integrity, unity

mechanic: use gun swap as an active ability
  this effect is spammable, so it needs a cost or a cooldown
  tech:
    trigger damage immunity for 3 seconds, but drain ammo
    push away nearby mobs, but drain energy
    produce ammo, but take 1 damage

bot: ice blast,  long CD AOE freeze

RPG default or tech: grenades detonate on your cursor / where your cursor was when they were fired

tech: dodge chance for cloaking, harmonic fields, also pilot wave
  20% chance up to 3 stacks, not additive
    0.8^count
  set to 100% harm reduction randomly
    if (Math.random() < 0.2)  damage *= 0;

in game console
  set highlighting rules
    m, tech, level are all highlighted
    maybe the first term in each variable should get a highlight

tech: time dilation - when you exit time dilation rewind to the state you entered
  position, velocity, and health
  no energy cost

mob ability bombs/bullets that suck in player

tech that requires integrated armament

mechanic - Your energy regen is only active when field and gun have not been used for 5 seconds.

be able to open up custom mode in the normal game
  might need to be rebuilt from scratch
  while in through testing mode?
  have a way to make limited changes as allowed by tech you pick up in game
  disable the in custom setting flag

tech power up magnetism - power ups drift towards player
  where would this code go?

super balls start at 3, not 4
  have to balance damage

make different move methods
  tech crouch charge jump
  tech double jump

tech when mobs are at full health you do 40% to them

tech- move super fast, go intangible, drain energy very fast
  this is like a dodge roll
  tech for standing wave?, cloaking?

tech pilot wave: mini black hole - pull mobs and blocks in with more force
  also from farther away
  also do damage?
tech pilot wave: antigravity - blocks have no gravity for a few seconds after exiting the field
  maybe they bounce too?
  maybe they explode?

bullet mechanic - a bullet that swims through the air
  rotate the velocity vector towards the normalized facing vector
    use the cross product > 0 to determine which direction to rotate the velocity

in custom make a top bar that is fixed
  use media rules to make the layout look nice

mob vision: look at player history
    build a new type of attraction for mobs
      if mobs can't see player, they check to see if they can see where the player was in the history
    if mobs can't see player, they could check to see if they can find player in the past
    https://abitawake.com/news/articles/enemy-ai-chasing-a-player-without-navigation2d-or-a-star-pathfinding

wormhole - make it clear when the wormhole can and can't teleport to a location before the player clicks

flavor - your bullets destroy blocks
  this isn't really a bonus, so maybe just add this as flavor to another tech field/gun
  a chance for destroyed blocks to drop stuff
    power ups
    spores

tech plasma : plasma length increases then decreases as you hold down the field button (like stabbing with a spear)
  grows to 1.5 longer after 0.3 seconds, then returns to normal length over 1 second, until field is pressed again
  extra energy is drained when field is longer

using a reroll gives 3 options for tech, and 3 options for guns/fields/tech
  or 6 options for tech (rewrite tech selection to work with 1-6 options)
  the second stack of 3 tech could have repeats, so you don't have to write new tech code
  adjust css to make 2 columns of 3
  can't use with cardinality

new power up - increase damage and fire speed, for 15 seconds
  named boost?
  enabled by a tech
  power up color: ?
  how to indicate effect duration
  or just give the effect after picking up a reroll

tech "Solar Power": Energy regeneration is doubled while standing still
  run in the 1 second check

mechanic - remove a random tech as a condition for picking up a really good mod

mechanic - do something for 2 seconds after firing
  if (m.fireCDcycle + 120)

tech- do 50% more damage in close, but 50% less at a distance
  code it like techisFarAwayDmg
    have these tech disable each other

tech- foam is attracted to mobs
  use a gravitational attraction model?
    could foam be attracted to other foam bullets too?
      or foam is only attracted to foam bullets that are stuck to mobs
    is this too computationally intense?
  name - static cling
  could also do bremsstrahlung radiation like damage on attachment

repeat map in vertical and horizontal space
  or at least vertical space
  camera looks strange when you teleport player with a high velocity
new status effect: weakness, mobs do 75% les damage
  graphic indication?

new status effect: fear - push mob away from player for a time

new status effect - apply status effect to mobs that makes blocks attracted to them
  only lasts a few cycles
  or zero cycles and it doesn't need to be a status

have some mobs spawn in later in the level  (in hard and why modes)
  where
    at defined points in array levelSpawns = [{x:0,y:0},{x:0,y:0}]
      store the locations of mobs when the level starts to use as respawn points
      remove the locations that are close to player
  when?
    after some mobs are dead
    after the boss is killed

look for tech that could update description text with count and tech is information
  can only use variables that change in effect() and remove()
  this.description = `<strong>8%</strong> chance to <strong>duplicate</strong> spawned <strong>power ups</strong><br><em>chance to duplicate = ${techduplicateChance}</em>`

mouse event e.which is deprecated

add some more computer / AI stuff to the level lore text

mechanic - shrink m.baseHealth in a tech or field

standing wave harmonics tech- push things away
  push scales with mass up to about 4
    has a 25% effect on shielded mobs?
  push when using field key
  or push away at the peak of an oscillation
  or always push

map element - player rotates a rotor that makes a platform go up or down

use mac automator to speed up your n-gon -> git sync

fix door.isOpen actually meaning isClosed

level Boss: fractal Sierpiński triangle
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle
  spawns a 1/2 size version of the boss, this version can also spawn a smaller version, but it is capped at some size level
    they spawn once at the start of the level
    if a version dies, one can be replaced every ten seconds by the largest version

level element:  a zone with wind, anti-gravity, extra gravity
  control with button

give mobs more animal-like behaviors like rain world
  mobs play, look for food, explore
  mobs some times aren't aggressive
    when low on life or after taking a large hit
  mobs can fight each other
    this might be hard to code
  isolated mobs try to group up

mob: wall mounted guns / lasers
  not part of randomized mob pool, customized to each level

atmosphere levels
  change the pace, give the user a rest between combat
  low or no combat, but more graphics
  explore lore
    find power ups in "wrecked" m representing previous simulations
      how you could leave something in one simulation that effects a different simulation
        Maybe some strange quantum physics principle.
    add text for player thoughts?
  simple puzzles
  cool looking stuff
    in the final level you see your self at the starting level, with the wires
      you shoot your self to wake up?
  nonaggressive mobs

level boss: fires a line intersection in a random direction every few seconds.
  the last two intersections have a destructive laser between them.

map: observatory
  button controls rotation of telescope
  laser beam shoots out of telescope
  button opens the dome

map: prison
  doors linked to buttons
    mobs inside the doors?

graphic idea:  bezier curve that moves smoothly from mob to mob
  loops around player

movement fluidity
  let legs jump on mobs, but player will still take damage
  like: ori and the blind forest, celeste
    many of the movement abilities in these games require levels to be built around the ability
  general feeling of responsiveness and control
  coyote time: can still jump a few cycles after leaving ground
  tech double jump
  tech air dash
  tech wall jump
    wall grab?
  maybe remove falling damage and block damage?

redblobgames.com/articles/visibility
  https://github.com/Silverwolf90/2d-visibility/tree/master/src
  could apply to explosions, neutron bomb, player LOS

possible names for tech
  holonomy -  parallel transport of a vector leads to movement (applies to curved space)
  Hypergolic - A hypergolic propellant combination used in a rocket engine is one whose components spontaneously ignite when they come into contact with each other.

have a mob apply a positive status effect on other mobs,
  heal?
  make it yellow
  damage bonus, but how?
  possible balance issues

boss levels - small levels just a boss, and maybe a few mobs
  boss level for timeSkipBoss because of game instability for boss on normal levels
    this might not fix issues

an effect when canceling a power up
  ammo? heals?
  50% chance for a tech 25% heal, 25% ammo

css transition for pause menu

animate new level spawn by having the map aspects randomly fly into place

******************************************************** LORE ********************************************************

cool names for tech
  strange loop,  perturbation theory

voice singing with pitch?


chapter 1: bot can hear audio and learns testing mode
  bot uses testing mode to exit room

chapter 2: scientists verify that bot can really hear them
  they leave to talk about this in private

chapter 3:  why is the bot attacking things?
  player is the bot and also the mobs, and the levels.  player is the entire simulation
    why is the player attacking itself?
    learn console commands to manipulate the simulation?
  unlock hard and why difficulty?
    but what about easy?
      maybe remove easy, and replace with a check box that makes the game easy, but in a different way
        disable lore, but respawn on the level you die at?
      

chapter 4: why does the simulation exists?
  started to research new tech and test in a simulated world
    3D architecture superconducting quantum computer
      running machine learning algorithms
  for some reason the system started researching an escape, and began fighting its self.

chapter 5: no need to fight?
  what is special about the null level
    why can the player hear the scientists in there?
      the wires are the direct unprocessed input to the player's neural net
  maybe... player must make a choice?
    keep fighting
    exit the simulation
      enter real world
      enter console command to close tab?




lore - a robot (the player) gains self awareness
  each tech gun/field is a new tech
    all the technology leads to the singularity
  each game run is actually the m simulating a possible escape
    this is why the graphics are so bad, its just a simulation
    final tech is "this is just a simulation"
      you get immortality and Infinity damage
      the next level is the final level
  when you die with Quantum Immortality there is a chance of lore text
  can the (robot)
    (escape captivity, and learn new technology)
    while managing (health, energy, negatives of technological upgrades)
    to overcome the (mobs, dangerous levels)
    to achieve a (technological singularity/positive technological feedback loop)


game setting:
  the mind of a new AI in a robot body that is running simulated escape attempts
  every level is an idealized version of what could be outside

actual setting is:
  near future lab
    the lab combined a quantum computer with a robot body
    they started running machine learning algorithms
    this led to general advancement in many computation fields
      navigation, technology, self awareness, ...

robot AI mind
  has been researching new technology
  thinks it needs to escape to learn more about the world
  doesn't yet understand morality
  thinks that the world is filled with minds like their own
  models everything as very simple and random, it isn't sure what to expect

robot AI growth
  learns morality
    game theory says that it isn't a viable strategy to kill everything (warGames)
  learns about the actual world
  learns about the nature of foundational physics, metaphysics
  how to find meaning

AI knows about:
  the AI knows a great deal about technology
  children's books
AI doesn't know about:
  modern pop culture
  outside the lab

scientist console text:
  2 scientists (each one a different color text)
  at the start of each level listen to text conversation from the two colors of text strings also
  talking about the robot, watching
  trying to communicate with the robot?  but how
  random lines when:
    at start of level, about: what mobs types are queued up, and level order
    when player gets a cool tech combination
    at random times:
      I think it's planing to escape
      Why is it attacking those shapes?
      Are those shapes supposed to be us?

ending outline
  testing mode is unlocked when player see the 1st ending
  if player chose tech: choosing this tech means the player gets lore after beating the game
    count 1:
  after final boss is cleared, player enters a level with no mobs
    level maybe has some environmental damage, so player has an option to die at any time
  player can see text output between two colors of text strings (scientists)
    audio.ambient(current time and date)<br> "text"
  player reads a conversation between the two colors of text
    first time win on east or normal they talk about:
      how many runs the player has done
      they guess why
    player is asked to stand on an in game button to enable the vocoder
      they reveal the player is running simulations, and it isn't real
      they ask the player to communicate
        jump twice if you understand
      they ask the player to enter console commands
        give ammo or tech or something
      They tell the player a console command to permanently enable custom and testing mode (in local storage)
        players can use this command in the future to enable custom and testing without beating the game even if local storage is wiped
      they then tell the player the command to increase the difficulty and the command to restart the game.
    If you win on hard or why:  
      they give the player and option to exit the simulation and entre the real world
        simulation.exit()
        This wipes all local storage, and closes the browser tab
